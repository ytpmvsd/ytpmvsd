## Introduction
YTPMVSD is a website that allows users to upload and share short video clips used in YTPMVs. Users must create accounts to share these, and as such, YTPMVSD must collect, store, and transmit personal information. This privacy policy will describe what information we collect, how we use it, and how you are able to control your information.

By using YTPMVSD, you agree to the collection and usage of data as described in this document.

## What We Collect

While users are able to browse the website and use all read-only features without an account, registration is required for some features to be available. When registering for an account, we collect:

- Your username

- Your password, encrypted with bcrypt

This information, excluding your username, is never shared publicly.

When uploading content to our website such as a sample, it is shown publicly to all users. In all cases, you are able to permanently delete your uploads freely by accessing the page for the sample.

## Usage of Your Data
We use your information for a few reasons:

- To create and manage your account
- To provide the features of the website
- To provide communication about your account and the website

As there are no ads on the website, and we don't provide anything to purchase, we do not use your information for marketing or advertising. 

## Disclosure of Your Data
We never share your personal information with any third parties. We may only disclose your data if we are legally required to. The only emails you may receive from us are the result of an action done on the website such as:

- Confirmation after registering an account
- Password changes

## Control of Your Data
As a user, you have the right to access or update your personal information at any time. This can currently be done by emailing us at privacy@ytpmvsd.com. In addition, you are free to delete any samples you have uploaded to the site by visiting the sample page in question.

You also have the ability to delete your account permanently by sending a request to the aforementioned email address. Please note that by default, your uploaded samples will remain on the website unless manually deleted, or you specify you would like all your samples deleted.

## Cookies
We strictly use necessary cookies to maintain your session data and login credentials across sessions. We do not use cookies for advertising or analytics.

## Data Retention
We keep your account information for as long as you have an account with us. If you request deletion of your data, we will permanently remove your data.

## Children
YTPMVSD is not designed for the use of children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover or are notified by a parent/guardian that a user under the age of 13 has submitted personal information, we will remove the information promptly.
